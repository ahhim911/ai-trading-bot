# Phase 1: Manual Annotation Plan
## Following Research Paper Methodology

### 🎯 Objective
Manually annotate initial Cup and Handle patterns to train the first YOLOv12 model, following the exact methodology from "Using AI for Stock Market Pattern Detection and Trading" research.

### 📊 Research Paper Baseline
- **Initial Manual Annotations**: 76 images (66 training + 10 validation)
- **Final Dataset**: 345 training + 55 validation samples
- **Success Rate**: 76% trading accuracy achieved

### 🎯 Our Phase 1 Plan

#### Step 1: Select Initial Annotation Set (76 images)
From our 112 generated charts, select the best 76 for initial annotation:

```bash
# Recommended selection criteria:
- Clear chart patterns visible
- Good volume data present
- Diverse market conditions (bull/bear/sideways)
- Multiple timeframes represented
- Various crypto symbols included
```

#### Step 2: Annotation Guidelines (Cup & Handle Specific)

**Pattern Requirements:**
- ✅ **Cup Depth**: 25-55% decline from peak
- ✅ **Cup Shape**: Rounded bottom (not V-shaped)
- ✅ **Cup Duration**: Several weeks to months
- ✅ **Handle Formation**: Small consolidation after recovery
- ✅ **Volume Pattern**: Decreasing in cup, increasing at breakout
- ✅ **Recovery Level**: 80%+ retracement of decline

**Bounding Box Standards:**
1. **Include Complete Pattern**: Entire cup + handle formation
2. **Tight Boundaries**: Minimize empty space around pattern
3. **Volume Confirmation**: Include volume panel if visible
4. **Clear Breakout Point**: Include the breakout area

#### Step 3: Annotation Tools (Choose One)

**Option A: Roboflow (Recommended)**
- Web-based: https://roboflow.com/
- Free tier: 1,000 images
- Auto-export to YOLO format
- Perfect for our 76 initial samples

**Option B: LabelImg (Desktop)**
```bash
cd ~/trading-bot-test
source trading_bot_env/bin/activate
labelImg training_charts/
```

#### Step 4: Pattern Classes (Following Research)
```yaml
Classes:
  0: cup_and_handle          # Primary pattern from research
  1: inverse_cup_and_handle  # Bearish variant
  2: double_bottom          # Alternative bullish pattern
  3: head_and_shoulders     # Reversal pattern
```

#### Step 5: Quality Control Checklist

For each annotation, verify:
- [ ] Pattern meets geometric requirements
- [ ] Volume confirmation visible
- [ ] Clear entry/exit points
- [ ] No ambiguous formations
- [ ] Bounding box includes complete pattern

### 📈 Expected Outcomes (Phase 1)

**Immediate Results:**
- 76 manually annotated high-quality samples
- YOLO-format dataset ready for training
- Baseline model trained on initial data

**Next Phase Preparation:**

### 📊 Success Metrics (Following Research)

**Phase 1 Targets:**
- **Annotation Quality**: >90% pattern accuracy
- **Model Performance**: >70% detection confidence
- **Dataset Balance**: Even distribution across pattern classes
- **Validation Split**: 85% training / 15% validation

**Final Goal (Following Paper):**
